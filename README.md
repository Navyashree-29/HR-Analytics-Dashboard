ðŸ”¹ Data visualization using tools like [Power BI/Tableau]

ðŸ”¹ Analyzing workforce trends and key HR metrics

ðŸ”¹ Automating reporting to enable real-time decision-making

ðŸ”¹ Turning raw data into actionable insights for HR strategy

Looking forward to applying these skills to drive business value and help organizations make informed, strategic decisions!
